To make your Java project compatible with Java 17 using GitHub Copilot, you can use the following prompts to assist with code changes, updates, and configuration adjustments.

### 1. **Prompt for updating dependencies to Java 17 compatibility:**
```
// Prompt: "Identify and update any dependencies that are incompatible with Java 17 in my project."
```

### 2. **Prompt for finding removed APIs or deprecated features:**
```
// Prompt: "Find any usages of deprecated or removed APIs that may no longer be available in Java 17 and suggest alternatives."
```

### 3. **Prompt for module system migration:**
```
// Prompt: "Check if the project uses Java 17 modules, and if not, suggest changes for migrating to the module system."
```

### 4. **Prompt for reflection and internal API access:**
```
// Prompt: "Identify any usages of reflection or internal APIs that might be restricted in Java 17 and recommend alternatives."
```

### 5. **Prompt for updating build configuration (Maven/Gradle):**
```
// Prompt: "Update the build configuration (Maven/Gradle) to use Java 17 as the target version."
```

### 6. **Prompt for ensuring compatibility with sealed classes, records, or pattern matching:**
```
// Prompt: "Check if the project can benefit from Java 17 features such as sealed classes, records, and pattern matching, and suggest refactoring where applicable."
```

### 7. **Prompt for reviewing switch expressions:**
```
// Prompt: "Find all traditional switch statements and suggest refactoring them to use switch expressions, if applicable."
```

### 8. **Prompt for replacing `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date`:**
```
// Prompt: "Identify any instances of `java.util.Date` or `java.sql.Date` and suggest replacing them with `java.time` APIs introduced in Java 8+."
```

### 9. **Prompt for updating SSL/TLS and security changes:**
```
// Prompt: "Review the usage of SSL/TLS and security configurations and ensure they are compatible with Java 17's security policies."
```

### 10. **Prompt for removing outdated JVM arguments:**
```
// Prompt: "Find outdated or unnecessary JVM arguments in the projectâ€™s build and run configurations, specifically those incompatible with Java 17."
```

These prompts should help you cover the major areas when transitioning your project to Java 17, including syntax, APIs, and build configuration.
